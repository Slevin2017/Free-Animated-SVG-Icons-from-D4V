Uses KeyshapeJS Animation which is the safest way to export SVG animations as they play on all modern web browsers. It uses a piece of JavaScript code, which animates the SVG document, so that all modern web browsers display the animation correctly.

All animations made by Juan Fernando Maguid using Keyshape app.
